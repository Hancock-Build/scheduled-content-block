## Description
Scheduled Content Block is a WordPress plugin which enables the easy scheduling of content on WordPress pages or posts via a new Scheduled Content block. This plugin makes creating scheduled content within blocks simple and completely hands-free.

## Features
- Simple container block, allowing you to display content within the block during a specific timeframe.
- Optional integration with the Breeze caching plugin, purging the site's cache when content is scheduled to become active or inactive.

## Changelog
- v0.0.1: Initial alpha release.
- v0.0.2: Fixed issue with the scheduled date/time not lining up with the set local time on WordPress.
- v0.0.3: Cleaned up the date/time display in the editor.
- v0.0.4: Added optional integration to the Breeze cache plugin to purge the cache when content is scheduled to go live and when it is scheduled to be removed.
- v0.0.5: Testing Codex PRs. What could go wrong? Made the block full-width to allow for flexible widths of content inside the block.
- v0.0.6: Improved the layout and wording of the schedule field and made some updates to ensure that scheduled times align with the site time.
